# Chess rules!

## Setup

1. Turn the board such that each player, sitting across from each other, sees a white square in the bottom right corner of the board.
1. Decide who is playing what color. When discussing chess, one generally uses the terms "white" and "black" to refer to each player for clarity.
1. Each player should put the queen on the square closest to them and the center of the board that matches the player's color.
1. Set up the rest of the pieces, lol.

## Object of the game

In chess, each player moves one of his/her pieces per turn. Each type of piece has a different movement style, all of which are described below. If the piece being moved lands on a square that is occupied by an enemy piece, the enemy piece is *captured* and removed from the board. Any white piece can capture any black piece, and vice versa.

**The object of the game is to capture your opponent's King.**

When a King is in danger of being captured, we say that the King is **in check**. So, whenever you finish a move and notice that you could capture the opponent's King on your next move, you are required to say "check" out loud right away. Always be aware of your opponent's King, and make sure you never forget to say "check"!

If your King is in check, you *must* save your King from imminent capture in one of these ways:

1. Move your King so that he cannot be captured.
1. Move one of your pieces to block the path of the attacking piece.
1. Capture the enemy's piece that is about to capture your King. Note that, if your King is in the capturing path of multiple enemy pieces, this will not remove your King from check; you must choose one of the above two methods of escape.

If you are unable to escape check, then you are trapped. Your opponent will likely realize this, having planned it all along; instead of saying "check", he/she ought to say "checkmate", which indicates that your King is trapped and the game is over. The losing player traditionally accepts defeat by knocking over his/her King piece on the board.

White always moves first.

## You got the moves

**King**: You have one. Losing your King means losing the game. The King moves one square in any direction.

**Queen**: You have one. The Queen can move any number of squares in any direction; the Queen is often regarded as the most powerful chess piece.

**Bishop**: You have two, one on each side of the King and Queen. A Bishop moves any number of squares in any *diagonal* direction. Note that you have one Bishop that moves on the white squares and one that moves on the black squares.

**Knight**: You have two, next to the Bishops. A Knight's movement makes an "L" shape, starting from the top of the "L": two squares non-diagonally in any direction, then one square perpendicular to the first movement in either direction. Also, a Knight is the only piece that can hop over other pieces. As long as the square where the Knight is going is empty (or occupied by an enemy piece), the Knight can move there.

**Castle (Rook)**: Formally known as a rook, but many people call it a castle, so it's whatever. You have two, in the corners of the board nearest you, sitting next to your Knights. A Castle moves any number of squares in any non-diagonal direction.

**Pawn**: You have eight, sitting in front of the more powerful pieces. A Pawn is the only piece that moves one way but captures a different way:

- Normally, a Pawn moves one square forward, but only into an unoccupied square.
- A Pawn can only capture by moving forward one square *diagonally*. A Pawn cannot move diagonally if there is nothing there to capture.
- If a Pawn has not been moved out of its starting position, you can optionally move it forward two squares instead of one, but a Pawn cannot capture anything this way (and both squares must be empty, as you'd expect).


### Special moves

#### Castling

Once per game, you are allowed to **castle** (*castle* is a verb this time). This is a special move, and the only move in which you move two pieces.

When castling, move your King left or right two spaces and move the Castle nearest the
you can't castle out of check
