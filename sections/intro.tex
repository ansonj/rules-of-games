\game{Introduction}

I like \LaTeX, games, and thinking about game rules. I don't like when game rules are made out to be more complicated than necessary. To help myself internalize game rules, and also help others who are learning games, I present this hobby project: \textsc{Rules of Games}.

\get[Finish this]
It's important for things to be explained in order of increasing complexity
``big picture first''
then details
Therefore, turn order is not always the best way to do things

Here's what I have planned:

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
    42 & In progress \\
    Bridge & Not started \\
    Egyptian Ratscrew & Not started \\
    Flip Cup & Not started \\
    Spades & Not started \\
    VC & Not started \\
\end{tabular}

\end{center}

Suggestions for more games to study are welcome, as are factual corrections, additional topics to add to an existing game, etc.
