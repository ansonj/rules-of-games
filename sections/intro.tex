\game{Introduction}

I like \LaTeX, games, and thinking about game rules. I don't like when game rules are made out to be more complicated than necessary. To help myself internalize game rules, and also help others who are learning games, I present this hobby project: \textsc{Rules of Games}.

seventh birthday
\emph{Card Games for Children} by Len Collis. big text and easy to understand. Organized by number of players

It's important for things to be explained in order of increasing complexity
``big picture first''
then details
Therefore, turn order is not always the best way to do things

I'm including games that I'm curious about and want to learn, or have had some experience with and had to learn
Here's what I have planned:

    Bridge & Not started \\
    Egyptian Ratscrew & Not started \\
    Flip Cup & Not started \\

\end{tabular}

Suggestions for more games to study are welcome, as are factual corrections, additional topics to add to an existing game, etc.
