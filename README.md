# Rules of Games

This is a LaTeX project to build a document about how to play various games, including games that I like and games that I've never played and am curious to learn. For more information, see [`intro.tex`](sections/intro.tex).

If you wish to view the assembled document, you can build it from source if you [have LaTeX installed](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation). The specific build commands are in [the fish shell build script](build.fish); execute the contents of `f_run_dry` and then `f_run_create`. If you don't want to do it the hard way, I will upload PDFs as releases when I reach major milestones, such as completing a section on a particular game.
